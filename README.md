**CSC 533 Homework 1:**
* To run this program, clone the repo and click on the html file to open it. It should pop up in your default browser. From there, click the button to select a ppm image on your computer. Then you just sit back and watch the transformations.
* As far as I'm aware, I worked out all of the bugs and kinks so that everything behaves as it should. The images rotate and shrinks somewhat seamlesslessly.
* I used homogeneous matrices in this assignment, so I would like that to be graded for extra credit.


Included files:
* index.html    -- a html file with a canvas
* a01.js        -- a javascript file for functionality with the image uploading, a method to parse PPM images, and handle transformations
* MathUtilities.js		-- some math functions that are used to do the matrix manipulations easily
* bunny.ppm     -- a test image
* pic1.ppm     -- a ppm image of a cup that I added
* README     -- this file describing the assignment
